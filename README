I'd like to thank those who have paid for and, thus, contributed to the time and effort that I put 
into authoring Aragorn.  Aragorn is my first iOS app.  I won't pretend to have used every best practice
in the book as I was (and still am) learning them as I go.

However, it is an effort in good faith.

It is in that same good faith that I have released the source for Aragorn under a Creative Commons 
Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 license.  I do not wish to see other gain materially from
my work but I gladly contribute my beginning here to the community at large to improve upon and
share *freely* (as in beer).
